Channel Clips Compilation
=========================

TODO:
* Build a list of clips and start/end or start/duration markers
* Download each clip (maintain a cache)
* Snip each clip (FFMPEG) to the appropriate part
* Combine the clips - mainly just concatenate
* Maybe allow title cards or captioning too?
